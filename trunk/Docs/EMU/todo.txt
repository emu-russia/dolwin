    [+] Make memcards work in games, by fixing DSP.

    [4] Solve 'PAD lost' problem


    UserMenu:
    ---------

    [3] Debug console manual. MAP files manual. Patch manual.
    [4] Debug replacement manual.
    [5] User variables and Dolwin configuration manual.
    [6] Join and cleanup all my GC hardware docs and rev. materials.

    [7] User FAQ and help manual.


    HighLevel:
    ---------

    [1] Finish matrix library HLE. Add more stdc calls. Cleanup.

    [2] OS Threads ? Should gain more speedup by eliminating VI wait retrace
    idle loop.

    [3] VI library ?

    [4] Finish DSP microcode emulation.

    Plugins:
    --------

    [2] Cleanup/speedup fifo command processor

    [3] Lighting, advanced lighting (C, vertex shaders)

    [4] Texgen (C, vertex shaders)

    [5] Texture cache, fast texture decoding

    [6] TEV approximation 'AI' :)

    [7] TEV shaders emulation

    [8] Debug: informative on-screen display, png texture dump, cam rotation,
    texture lookup, fifo commands dump, fifo dump...
