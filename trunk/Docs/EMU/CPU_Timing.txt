
Here is meaning of CPU Timing values :

- CPU Delay. How often TBR and DEC are updated. Number of opcodes.
- Hardware Update Bailout. Hardware is updated, when this counter
  become zero (HWUpdate will be called). Then set counter to initial
  value.
- Counter Factor. The value to change TBR and DEC: TBR += CF, DEC -= CF.

TBR and DEC are Gekko timing internal registers (simply timers). So if you increase delay and counter factor, you're kinda "overclock" Gekko CPU. If you increase hardware bailout, you'll get longer response from GC hardware. You can tweak all values as you want - sometimes you may get more speed, but sometimes you may get crash dialog box. I use 2-5-1 often, and 5-2-1 sometimes. We still dont know most compatible values, but default (1-12-1) should be stable for all games.
